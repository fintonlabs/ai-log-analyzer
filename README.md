# A Python utility that uses AI to analyze system logs and detect anomalies, summarizing errors and patterns in real-time

## Overview
This project is a Python utility that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to monitor and analyze system logs in real-time. It is designed to provide an efficient and systematic way of spotting anomalies and summarizing error patterns. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically an Isolation Forest model, this utility can effectively identify unusual activities in the logs, thus facilitating quick response and resolution. This utility is extremely useful in maintaining the health of the system, enhancing security, and reducing downtime.

## Features
The core functionality of the project is encapsulated in the `LogMonitor` class. The following is a detailed description of its features:

- **Directories Monitoring üìÅ**: The `LogMonitor` class is initialized with a list of directories (`log_dirs`) to monitor. The utility continuously checks these directories for any new logs. This feature allows the utility to be flexible and scalable, capable of monitoring multiple directories simultaneously.

- **Real-time Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è**: The `monitor_logs` method is designed to work in an infinite loop, constantly checking for new log files and reading new entries. This ensures that the system logs are analyzed in real-time, allowing for immediate detection and response to any anomalies.

- **Machine Learning Integration ü§ñ**: An Isolation Forest model (`self.model`) is used to analyze the log data. Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm for anomaly detection that works on the principle of isolating anomalies instead of the most common data points. This makes it exceptionally good at identifying anomalies in the system logs.

- **Alert Threshold üö®**: An alert threshold (`alert_threshold`) can be set during the initialization of the `LogMonitor` class. If an anomaly score exceeds this threshold, an alert is generated. This feature is crucial for flagging critical anomalies that require immediate attention.

- **Error Summary üìä**: A summary of errors (`error_summary`) is maintained using a Python `defaultdict`. This provides a quick and easy way to understand the frequency and types of errors occurring in the system.

- **Alerts Management üì¢**: All alerts generated by the system are stored in the `alerts` list. This provides a historical record of all anomalies detected, which can be used for further analysis and improvement of the system.

- **Thread-Safe Execution üîí**: The use of threading module hints that this utility might be designed to work in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring that the execution is thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can be created to monitor different directories without interfering with each other.
  
This project provides a robust solution for real-time system log monitoring and anomaly detection, contributing significantly to proactive system health management and error resolution.

# Installation Guide for LogMonitor

This guide helps you install and configure LogMonitor, a Python utility that uses AI to analyze system logs and detect anomalies.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python 3.7 or later**: You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pip**: Pip is a package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage Python packages. If you have Python 3.4 or later, Pip is included by default.

3. **Scikit-learn**: LogMonitor uses the Scikit-learn library for its machine learning capabilities. You can install Scikit-learn using Pip.

Here's how to install Scikit-learn:

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## Installation Process

Follow these steps to install LogMonitor:

1. **Download the Project**

   Download the project from the repository and extract it to a directory of your choice.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the project.

```bash
cd /path/to/extracted/project/
```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**

   Install the required Python packages using Pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Verification

To verify if LogMonitor is installed correctly, try running the script:

```bash
python log_monitor.py
```

If the script runs without throwing any errors, LogMonitor is installed correctly.

## Post-installation Configuration

After the installation, you need to configure LogMonitor:

1. **Initialize LogMonitor**

   Initialize LogMonitor with the directories containing the log files to monitor and an alert threshold.
   Here's an example:

```python
log_monitor = LogMonitor(['/var/log', '/tmp/logs'], 0.5)
```

In the example above, LogMonitor will monitor the '/var/log' and '/tmp/logs' directories. The alert threshold is set to 0.5.

2. **Start Log Monitoring**

   Call the `monitor_logs` method to start monitoring the logs.

```python
log_monitor.monitor_logs()
```

With this, LogMonitor will start monitoring the specified log directories in real-time. If it detects any anomalies that exceed the alert threshold, it will generate an alert.

<a name="basic"></a>
## 1. Basic Usage

To use the `LogMonitor` class, you need to provide directories to be monitored and an alert threshold. Below is an example:

```python
# Create instance of LogMonitor
dirs_to_monitor = ["/path/to/log/directory1", "/path/to/log/directory2"]
alert_threshold = 0.5
monitor = LogMonitor(dirs_to_monitor, alert_threshold)

# Start monitoring logs
monitor.monitor_logs()
```

<a name="usecases"></a>
## 2. Common Use Cases

This utility can be used in the following scenarios:

- **Real-time log analysis**: If you need to monitor and analyze logs in real-time to detect any anomalies or errors.
- **System health monitoring**: Use it to evaluate the health of your system by setting a threshold for alerts. Any anomaly score beyond this threshold will be considered as an alert.
- **Trend analysis**: By analyzing the error summary, one can identify patterns and trends in system errors.

<a name="cli"></a>
## 3. Command-line Arguments

This program is designed to be run as a script, therefore, command-line arguments are not applicable for this utility. Parameters are passed directly to the class constructor when creating an instance.

<a name="output"></a>
## 4. Expected Output

The `monitor_logs` method runs indefinitely, analyzing logs and updating the `error_summary` dictionary. The dictionary's keys are the types of errors encountered and the values are the number of times these errors have occurred. 

The `alerts` list will be updated with any anomalies detected that surpass the alert threshold. Each alert is a tuple with the log file name and the anomaly score.

<a name="advanced"></a>
## 5. Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage, you can extend the `LogMonitor` class to add custom processing for specific log files or error types. For example, you could add a method to send an email notification for certain types of alerts:

```python
class AdvancedLogMonitor(LogMonitor):
    def notify(self, alert):
        # Send email notification here
        pass

    def process_log_file(self, filename):
        super().process_log_file(filename)

        for alert in self.alerts:
            self.notify(alert)
```

Remember to import the necessary modules for sending email notifications and add appropriate error handling.

# LogMonitor API Documentation

## Class Description

`LogMonitor` is a utility class that monitors and analyzes system logs in real-time using AI. It uses an isolation forest model to detect anomalies and summarizes errors and patterns.

## Class Methods

### `LogMonitor.__init__(self, log_dirs: List[str], alert_threshold: float)`

This method initializes the `LogMonitor` with directories to monitor and an alert threshold.

#### Parameters:

- `log_dirs`: A list of strings which are the directories to monitor.
- `alert_threshold`: A float value that represents the alert threshold.

#### Returns:

This method does not return a value.

#### Example:

```python
log_monitor = LogMonitor(["/var/log", "/var/log/syslog"], 0.5)
```

---

### `LogMonitor.monitor_logs(self)`

This method continuously monitors and reads new entries in system log files.

#### Parameters:

This method does not have any parameters.

#### Returns:

This method does not return a value. It runs indefinitely until the program is stopped.

#### Example:

```python
log_monitor.monitor_logs()
```

## Class Variables

### `LogMonitor.log_dirs`

A list of strings which are the directories to monitor. Initialized in the constructor.

### `LogMonitor.alert_threshold`

A float value that represents the alert threshold. Initialized in the constructor.

### `LogMonitor.model`

An instance of IsolationForest, a hypothetical machine learning model used for anomaly detection.

### `LogMonitor.error_summary`

A defaultdict (from collections) with integer values that keeps track of error summaries.

### `LogMonitor.alerts`

A list of alerts generated by the LogMonitor.

## Best Practices

- Initialize the `LogMonitor` with the directories of the system logs that you want to monitor and an appropriate alert threshold.
- Use `monitor_logs()` method to start monitoring the logs. This method runs indefinitely until the program is stopped.
- The `LogMonitor` class is not thread-safe. If you need to monitor logs from multiple threads, you should create a separate `LogMonitor` instance for each thread.

## Common Patterns

The most common use of `LogMonitor` is to continuously monitor system logs for anomalies. This is typically done by initializing a `LogMonitor` with the directories of the system logs and an alert threshold, and then calling the `monitor_logs()` method.

```python
log_monitor = LogMonitor(["/var/log", "/var/log/syslog"], 0.5)
log_monitor.monitor_logs()
```

This will start the monitoring process and it will continue indefinitely until the program is stopped. The detected anomalies and error summaries are stored in the `error_summary` and `alerts` variables of the `LogMonitor` instance.
